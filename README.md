# Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using visual and statistical exploration.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `titanic_eda.ipynb` : Notebook with code, graphs and observations
- `titanic_eda.pdf` : Exported PDF report
- `train.csv` : Dataset from Kaggle
- `README.md` : Project details

## Insights (Summary)
- Women and children had higher survival rates than men.
- 1st class passengers had much better survival chances compared to 3rd class.
- Passengers who paid higher fares survived more often.
- Strong relationship between Pclass, Fare, and Survival.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Open `titanic_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce analysis.
4. View the `titanic_eda.pdf` report for final results.
